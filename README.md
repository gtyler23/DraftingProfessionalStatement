<h2>Personal Statement</h2>

I am a loving father to a beautiful family of 6 (5 kids and wife), and a U.S. Coast Guard Officer who HONORABLY served his country for 15 years, with four of those years serving in the U.S. Navy in aviation.  During my tenure of multiple jobs and responsibilities throughout my highly dynamic military career, my most promising and enjoyable moment was serving as an Information Systems Technician (IT).  I enjoy learning and hold multiple IT certificates and a myriad of degrees, including a Masters.  I like creating spreadsheets for organizational purposes, and enjoy analyzing complex problems.  I have a passion for technology and a desire for helping others through collaboration, mentoring and being a mentee.  I am extremely interested in the field of security and want to build off my current IT skills and former military background to obtain an entry-level cybersecurity position that will utilize my drive and thirst for knowledge, and to maximize my contribution to the organization, community, and country as a military veteran.

<h2>Professional Statement</h2>

I have consistently proven my ability to meet deadlines and achieve project objectives, solve mission-critical problems and prioritize crucial tasks while maintaining the high standards expected of my role. I am currently seeking a long-term position to make significant contributions through the commitment of meeting organizational objectives through safeguarding business and client assets.
